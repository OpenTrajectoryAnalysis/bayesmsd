    "# Writing your own fits\n",
    "``bayesmsd`` can fit any parametric shape of MSD curves; however, utilizing that full flexibility requires a little bit of coding. This tutorial will walk you through the implementation of a new fit model, ``TwoLocusRouseFit``. Note that a production version of this class is available in ``bayesmsd.lib``; after working through the—somewhat streamlined—implementation in this example, you can check its source code to see the last finishing touches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we will implement a fit to the following functional expression:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:MSD}\n",
    "\\text{MSD}(\\Delta t) = 2\\sigma^2 + 2\\Gamma\\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\left(1-\\text{e}^{-\\frac{\\tau}{\\Delta t}}\\right) + 2J\\,\\text{erfc}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{\\Delta t}}\\,,\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\tau\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{J}{\\Gamma}\\right)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ are the spatial positions of two loci at fixed positions along a polymer, the above expression is the MSD we should expect to see for the relative position $y(t)\\equiv x_2(t) - x_1(t)$, assuming the polymer dynamics follow the Rouse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we fit something like this? ``bayesmsd`` provides the whole fitting machinery in form of an abstract base class ``Fit``, which we can subclass to implement a new fit model. Upon doing so, our main task is to override the method ``params2msdm()``, which gives the functional form of the MSD dependent on the parameters. Of course we also have to specify which parameters we need and how they relate to each other. Let's get started!"

    "That's already the full definition of this function. After assigning local variable names to the parameters (mainly for readability) we define the MSD function and then return it. Let's take a look at some details, starting from the end:\n",
    "\n",
    " + ``params2msdm`` should return a separate MSD function for each of the ``self.d`` dimensions in the data set. In this simplified implementation of ``TwoLocusRouseFit`` we assume that all dimensions are identical, so we can just copy the same values to all dimensions.\n",
    " + Beyond the MSD, ``params2msdm`` should also return the first moment for the Gaussian process, which corresponds to a constant offset (for ``ss_order = 0``, i.e. stationary processes) or a drift term (for ``ss_order = 1``, i.e. increment stationary processes). For the most part this should just be zero; this is why we return ``(msd, 0)`` tuples instead of just the ``msd`` functions for each dimension.\n",
    " + In defining the ``msd`` function\n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   def msd(dt, G=G, J=J, tau=tau)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   we pass all the parameters as default arguments. This is important to get the scoping right; default arguments are evaluated at definition time, whereas references to external variables (i.e. if we did not use this default argument construction) are evaluated at execution time. By then the values might have changed from what we wanted to use in the definition.\n",
    " + The ``bayesmsd.deco.imaging()`` decorator adds imaging artifacts to the MSD, specifically motion blur and localization error. Motion blur is determined from the fractional exposure $f\\in[0, 1]$—this is the ratio of shutter time over frame time, i.e. $f=0$ is ideal stroboscopic illumination, $f=1$ is continuous illumination—and the effective short time MSD scaling $\\alpha_0$. The latter is just the log-slope of the \"true\" MSD (no motion blur or localization error) at a time lag of 1 frame, which for our Rouse model example is always 0.5.\n",
    " + Finally, the ``bayesmsd.deco.MSDfun`` decorator extends the validity of the time lag ``dt`` to the real line. Note how we did not have to take any precautions against division by 0 or square roots of negative numbers in defining the ``msd()`` function. Indeed, the ``MSDfun`` decorator guarantees that the ``dt`` argument is always a numpy array with strictly positive values: anything else will be patched using the analytical identities $\\text{MSD}(-\\Delta t)\\equiv \\text{MSD}(\\Delta t)$ and $\\text{MSD}(\\Delta t) = 0$."
